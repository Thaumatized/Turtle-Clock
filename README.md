An analog clock made with the turtle library.  
  
Back when working for SSKKY, we had the students do an exercise where they had to create a protocol to share turtle movements with each other and this inspired me to control multiple turtles at the same time with a similiar method.  
  
Now that I gained control of multiple turtles at the same time, An analog clock seemed like the smartest thing I could do with it.  

Turtle uses memory for lines even if they are drawn over, so this is something to look for if you implement something with this code. Undoing will free the memory up, which what the clock uses too.
