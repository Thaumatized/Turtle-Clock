An analog clock made with the turtle library.  
  
Back when working for SSKKY, we had the students do an exercise where they had to create a protocol to share turtle movements with each other and this inspired me to control multiple turtles at the same time with a similiar method.  
  
Now that I gained control of multiple turtles at the same time, An analog clock seemed like the smartest thing I could do with it.  

Right now, something hogs up memory. I think it is Turtle keeping data of lines which have been drawn over. As a tempoary solutions, which has been in use for like two years now, the clock gets redrawn every 5 minutes.
